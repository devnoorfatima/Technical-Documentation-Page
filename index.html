                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                    the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Javascript and java</h2>
                </header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the
                    reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
                    The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                    individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
                    can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                </header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);<br>
                    }
                    greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                    <h2>Variable</h2>
                </header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <section>
                <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>
                    var x = 42 <br>
                </code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.For Example:</p>
                <code>
                    let y= 13 <br>
                </code>
            </section>
            <!-- 5th section ends here -->
            <!-- 6th section starts here -->
            <section class="main-section">
                <header id="constant">
                    <h2>Constant</h2>
                </header>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. </p>
                <code>
                    const PI = 3.14; <br>
                </code>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <code>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR <br>
                    function f() {}; <br>
                    const f = 5; <br>
                    // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO <br>
                    function f() { <br>
                    const g = 5; <br>
                    var g; <br>
                    //statements <br>
                    } <br>
                </code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.</p>
                <code>
                    const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; 
                    MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue"; 
                </code>
